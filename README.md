    sauceRest = "1.0.35"

#### System requirements

* Java 8
* Gradle
* Chrome browser

### Environment Setup

1. Make sure Java 8 SDK is installed and configured (path to Java bin folder is added to PATH environment variable on Windows)

2. Install Gradle:
    * Download [Gradle](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and follow installation instructions. For MacOS users: install Gradle with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
        ```
        $ brew install gradle
        ``` 
2. Sauce Labs Credentials: 

    Use your sauce credentials or register a new user on [saucelabs.com](https://saucelabs.com/).
    Add sauce credentials to environment variables:
   
    * For Windows: add two new Environment Variables (restart required)

    * For *nix: in terminal, export your Sauce Labs credentials as environmental variables:
        ```
        $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
        $ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
        ```

3. In order to use local ChromeDriver, use next configuration:

    * Download the latest version of ChromeDriver from: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
    
    * Under 'utils' folder create a new directory, with name that matches your ChromeDriver version (e.g. "2.27")

    * Copy ChromeDriver executable to created folder.

    * Update *ChromeDriverVersion* in **test.properties** file:

            ChromeDriverVersion = 2.27
        
    * Set property *localRun* in **test.properties** file to *true*: 
    
            localRun = false

#### Running

* In terminal run Gradle from project root:
       
    * Use e2e target for running all tests:
    
        ```
        $ gradle clean e2e
        ```

    * you can use --info key for observing the test output in console:

        ```
        $ gradle clean e2e --info
        ```
